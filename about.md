# Mouse Guard

In the world of Mouse Guard, mice struggle to live safely and prosper amongst harsh conditions
and a host of predators. Thus the Mouse Guard was formed: more than just soldiers, they are guides
for common mice looking to journey without confrontation from one village to another.
They see to their duty with fearless dedication so that they may not simply exist, but truly live.
