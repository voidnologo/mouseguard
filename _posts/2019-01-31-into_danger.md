Preparing to set off on a new quest, the party poured over Qunintain's maps.
Unfortunately, they barely even showed the location of Walnutpeck, and no
roads leading to the town.  So our party set off foraging through the wilderness,
Mr. Short in tow, trying to find their way to Walnutpeck.

Along the way, however, disaster struck!  That villianous raven, so pleased with
itself at its first theivery, returned to make another attempt at the party's
treasures. Drawn by the glitter of Dain's sword, it swooped down and proceded
with its nefarious plans.

Flapping its wings and squacking loudly, the raven circled around the party
seeking an advantagous spot to launch its attack.  Quintain swiftly drew his
bow and tried to force the bird to the side as the party began darting for
cover in the roots of a nearby tree.  However, in the frantic action, Quintain's
bow snagged on his quiver and both were scattered on the ground. Robin
fiented to one side to distract the raven allowing the party to draw closer
to a hiding place.  The raven, seeing his quarry escaping, lunged forward and
made a grab at Dain's sword, only to be rebuffed.

Robin leapt forward, taking wild swings with his spear in an attempt to drive
the raven away.  The reprehensible fiend knocked his spear out of his paws
and sent it clattering across the ground.  Quintain managed to help the
party get closer to hiding, and then tragedy!  Dain attempted to trick our execrable
opponent, who's iniquitious past had trained it well to anticipate such a move,
and the raven snatched the shining blade from his paw.

Our reprobate cretin launched into the air and began to fly away.  However, cawing
with triumph, the foul fowl lost its grip and our party saw the sword tumble to the
ground, crashing into the underbrush.  With a vengeful cry, they darted out
through the woods in a desperate search for the blade.  Finally spotting a
glint of light, they are able to recover the sword.

Mr. Short had been huddling in fear the whole time was grateful to continue
on with the quest.  As we shall continue to see, he is virtually worthless
for participation in such high adventure.  Clearly not material to recommend
for being a member of the Guard at all.

As evening approached, the party finds themselves on the edges of Walnutpeck.
Careful observation reveals that there are indeed weasles inhabiting parts of the town!
Fearing for his safety, the party learns the location of Mr. Short's home and
details of the chair, and safely hide him in the brush at the outskirts of town.

Cautiously the part crept through town to the Short home.  Homes are unmaintained,
landscaping neglected, it is fortunate that only a small patrol of vermin are
living in the abandoned town.  Once safely ensconced in the home, our mice
hear voices outside!  Robin wedges the front door shut with pieces of wood he
finds in the house, while Dain thoroughly investigates the rest of the house
making sure there is a back way out and no other threats.  Quintain sketches
out the layout of the town and the path they used to arrive here so the
party can begin to plan their escape.
