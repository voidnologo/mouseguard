Impassioned at the loss of the mail, our party frantically sets off into the woods
searching for a raven's nest.  After a good deal of searching they noticed a nest
high in a tree.

Unperturbed, young Robin grabbed a length of rope and began climbing.  Eventually
he found himself on the branch with the nest.  With a great deal of caution, Robin
edged out onto the branch and up to the nest.  He sighed with relief, the raven
was not there; and the mailbag was lying safely amongst the eggs!

Our fearless young mouse scrambled into the nest and retrieved the mail, after
thinking fiendish thoughts of ways to strike back at the raven.  He carefully made
his way back down the tree and to his waiting companions.

Our party once again in possession of their precious cargo continued on their way
to the final town of Gilpledge.

Everyone was relieved to have made it safely, and tried to calm down from the arduous
journey.  Quintain relaxed by updating his maps, but Dain's and Robin's tempers still
flared at thoughts of the dasterdly raven.

Soon after arriving in the town, the party was approached by a Mr. Martin Short. His
daughter is soon to be wed, and he would like to present as her dowery his grandmother's
wonderful rocking chair.  Unfortunately, it is still in the old family home in
Walnutpeck, a nearby villiage that was overrun and lost to the mouse territories
during the recent war with the weasels.  Would the Guard be so courageous to go forth
and bring back the family heirloom?

Dain, older and wiser, cautioned against such a foolhardy mission, heading into enemy
territory with just the small patrol.  Robin, full of youthful enthusiasm and a desire
to show how great the Guard was, argued that they should take pity on the mouse and
help him if they could.  Eventually he wore down the resistance of the senior mice
and our party agreed to try to recover the rocking chair.
