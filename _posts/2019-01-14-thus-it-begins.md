Gwendolyn invites our adventures into her office for a mission briefing.  It is early spring
with the thaws well underway.  Roads are opening up and mice are beginning to stir.  Mail
has been accumulating at the post and patrols are starting to set off to deliver the winter
coorespondences.  Would we please take a satchel of mail and deliver it?

Glad to get out after being cooped up all winter, our party sets off.

Dain, senior patrol leader, vows to make sure the mouse-folk get their awaited messages. Quintain, Dain's
long time friend, is excited to map their route.  Fresh tender-paw Robin, newly assigned as Quintain's
mentee, can hardly wait to prove himself to the patrol.

The brisk spring air stings a bit as the patrol searches for paths between the scattered melting snow banks
and muddy puddles that stretch out across the roadways.  Young and eager, Robin pushes ahead, forging
ahead of the party looking for clear paths.  Dain and Quintain contentedly follow, giving him advice
on what to look for and sketching the route.

The party makes it through a couple of the towns, dropping off mail as they go.  However, as they travel
further, inclement weather begins to threaten.  Our mice scout around and notice some shelter in a
hollowed out log.  They dart in, grateful for some cover.

Unfortunately, another creature has also taken shelter here in the log.  A large raven stares at
the three mice with baleful eyes.  Clutching the precious mail bag tightly, Dain suggests they leave
and find cover somewhere else.  Mr. Raven, seeing something so apparently precious, makes a grab
for the mail!

Quintain launches an arrow from his small bow, driving the bird back.  As Dain tries to cover and protect
the bag, the raven quickly circles around the party trying to get a better angle.  This brings him closer
to fearless Robin, who thrusts forward with his spear, narrowly missing the raven, which lunges forward
over the party and snatches the bag from Dain's grasp before flying out into the woods.

With a cry of anger, our mice run out trying to follow the path of the bird as it disappears into the trees.
Knowing ravens tend to roost this time of year, the party begins scouting around looking for nests
in the treetops, using all of their hunter lore to track and guess where the raven may have gone.

Vowing to recover the mail, our party's quest stretches on with this unexpected twist...

Tune in next time for more amazing adventures.  Will they find the Raven?  Can the mail be recovered?
